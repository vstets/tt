/**
 * Appends show and hide logic for views (App.view.base.View). This mixin was created only for views classes. It
 * doesn't work with other classes, because it uses view's public interface and internal logic. Show and hide
 * means showing and hiding all html tags for current view starting from root node. It uses CSS display property
 * for that. Showing and hiding works only for rendered views. Before showing and hiding it fires specified
 * events (beforeshow, beforehide) and calls onBeforeShow() and onBeforeHide() methods. You may override these
 * methods and if they returns false, the it prevents showing or hiding. After show/hide it fires show and hide
 * events and calls onAfterShow() and onAfterHide() methods.
 * This mixin should be used in case if your view is inherited from App.view.base.View and it need to be showed
 * and hided. For this, you need to add it in your class (not in base view) in mixins section.
 *
 * Available events:
 *
 *     beforeshow    Fires before showing view
 *     show          Fires after view shows
 *     beforehide    Fires before hiding view
 *     hide          Fires after view hide
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     N13.define('App.view.MyView', {
 *         extend: 'App.view.base.View',
 *         mixins: {show: 'App.mixin.view.Show'},
 *         ...
 *     });
 *
 *     var view = new App.view.MyView();
 *     view.render('.container');
 *     view.hide();
 *     view.show();
