/**
 * Base controller class. All controllers should be derived from this one. The main idea of the controller in
 * listening of events from different objects and call appropriate handlers. This class contains only basic
 * controlling logic. It can create, run, stop and destroy controller. Every methods from this list calls
 * before and after methods. For example, run() method calls onBeforeRun() and onAfterRun() methods inside.
 * You may override these methods for your needs. Also, you may return false in on/beforeRun() method and
 * as a result this controller will not be run. This rule works for all other methods as well.
 * There are additional controller mixins, which extends this class. For example, if your controller should
 * work with views, you may add controller.View mixin for that. For details, about special controller's mixins
 * see App.mixin.controller.* namespace.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     N13.define('App.controller.my.Controller', {
 *         extend  : 'App.controller.base.Controller',    // This is parent class, we are inherited from
 *         mixins  : {view: 'App.mixin.controller.View'}, // Turns view functionality on for this class. It adds findView() method.
 *         requires: 'App.view.my.MainView',              // We should add main view class to requires section
 *         configs : {view: 'my.MainView'},               // This is how we are creating the view. It should be with autoRender: true config
 *
 *         onAfterInit: function () {                     // Here we may bind event handlers to views
 *             this.findView('my.MainView').listen(       // Add ready event handler
 *                 'ready',
 *                 this._onReady,
 *                 this
 *             );
 *         },
 *         onReady: function () {                         // 'ready' event handler
 *             alert('Main view is ready!!!');
 *         }
 *     });
